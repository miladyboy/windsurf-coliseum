This document outlines the steps to implement "Sword Duel," a 3D multiplayer sword-fighting game using three.js and WebSockets. Follow each section in order to build the game systematically.

Project Setup
Objective: Create the foundation for the 3D environment.

Steps:
Set up a basic three.js project with a scene, perspective camera, and WebGL renderer.

Add a simple ground plane (e.g., a large flat mesh) to serve as the arena floor.

Include basic lighting: an ambient light and a directional light to illuminate the scene.

Position the camera initially to view the arena from above.

Implement an animation loop to continuously render the scene.

2. Player Movement
   Objective: Enable player movement using WASD keys.

Steps:
Create a simple player object (e.g., a cube or a 3D model placeholder).

Implement keyboard input handling to detect when WASD keys are pressed.

Update the player's position based on key presses:
W: Move forward

A: Strafe left

S: Move backward

D: Strafe right

Ensure movement is relative to the camera's direction (to be refined after camera setup).

3. Attacking and Defending
   Objective: Implement attacking and defending mechanics using arrow keys.

Steps:
Define states for attacking and defending.

Map arrow keys to specific attack directions:
Left Arrow: Left swing

Right Arrow: Right swing

Up Arrow: Overhead swing

Down Arrow: Thrust

Implement defending by holding Shift + arrow keys to block in corresponding directions.

Add visual feedback (e.g., change player color) to indicate when the player is attacking or defending.

Set timers to limit the duration of attacks and blocks (e.g., 0.5 seconds).

4. Camera System
   Objective: Create a locked or auto-follow camera that keeps both players in view.

Steps:
Add a second player object to represent the opponent.

Calculate the midpoint between the two players.

Position the camera to view this midpoint from a suitable distance and height.

Ensure the camera smoothly follows the midpoint as players move.

Adjust the camera's look-at target to always focus on the midpoint.

5. Hit Detection and Scoring
   Objective: Detect successful attacks and track scores.

Steps:
Implement a basic hit detection system:
When a player attacks, check if the opponent is within a certain distance (e.g., 2 units).

If the opponent is not blocking or blocking in the wrong direction, register a hit.

Track scores for each player, incrementing when they land a hit.

Determine the winner when a player reaches three hits.

Display the current score in the console or a basic UI element.

6. Multiplayer Functionality
   Objective: Enable real-time multiplayer using WebSockets.

Steps:
Set up a simple server using Node.js and Socket.IO.

Connect the client to the server and handle player connections.

Synchronize player data:
Send player position, attack state, and block state to the server.

Receive and update the opponent's position and states.

Ensure smooth synchronization to minimize latency issues.

7. Visual and Audio Enhancements
   Objective: Improve the game's aesthetics and immersion.

Steps:
Replace placeholder models with 3D character models (e.g., from Mixamo or Sketchfab).

Add animations for attacks and blocks if models support them.

Implement sound effects for:
Sword swings

Successful blocks

Hits

Optionally, add background music or ambient sounds.

8. User Interface
   Objective: Create a basic UI for game interaction.

Steps:
Design a main menu with a "Start Game" button.

Implement a score display that updates in real-time.

Add a game-over screen or message when a player wins.

Ensure the UI is responsive and doesnâ€™t obstruct the game view.

9. Testing and Debugging
   Objective: Ensure all features work correctly.

Steps:
Test each component individually:
Movement

Attacking and defending

Camera behavior

Hit detection and scoring

Multiplayer synchronization

Debug common issues such as:
Input conflicts (e.g., multiple keys pressed)

Network latency or desynchronization

Camera jitter or incorrect positioning

Use browser developer tools to inspect and fix errors.

10. Optimization and Polish
    Objective: Refine the game for a smooth experience.

Steps:
Optimize performance by limiting frame rate or reducing model complexity.

Smooth out animations and camera movements for a polished feel.

Add final visual effects, such as particle systems for hits or sword trails.

Ensure the game runs well on target hardware (e.g., modern browsers).

Best Practices
Code Organization: Use separate files or modules for different components (e.g., player, camera, networking).

Comments: Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of the code.

Version Control: Use Git to track changes and commit regularly with meaningful messages.

Additional Notes
Start with simple shapes and placeholders, then replace them with final assets.

Test frequently to catch issues early.

Refer to the three.js documentation and WebSocket tutorials for specific implementation details.
