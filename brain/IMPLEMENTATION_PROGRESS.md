- âœ… Implemented smooth camera transitions
- âœ… Positioned camera to show a side view of the duel

#### 7. Multiplayer Functionality
- âœ… Set up WebSocket server using Socket.IO
- âœ… Implemented player data synchronization
- âœ… Created GameManager class to handle game state on the server
- âœ… Set up hit registration and score tracking

#### 8. User Interface
- âœ… Created main menu with start button
- âœ… Implemented score display
- âœ… Added game over screen with winner announcement
- âœ… Included controls information

#### 9. Testing Framework
- âœ… Set up Jest for both client and server
- âœ… Created mocks for three.js and Socket.IO
- âœ… Prepared test directory structure

### In Progress / Remaining Tasks

- ðŸ”„ Create smoother animations for sword movements

#### 4. Advanced Game Features
- ðŸ”„ Add different attack types or special moves
- ðŸ”„ Implement player stamina system
- ðŸ”„ Create multiple arena options

#### 5. Performance Optimization
- ðŸ”„ Optimize rendering for better performance
- ðŸ”„ Reduce network traffic with delta compression
- ðŸ”„ Implement client-side prediction

## Technical Implementation

### Client Architecture
The client-side codebase follows a modular approach with these key components:

1. **Game** - Central manager that coordinates other components
2. **Player** - Handles local player state and input
3. **Opponent** - Manages remote player representation
4. **Arena** - Creates and manages the game environment
5. **CameraController** - Handles camera positioning and movement
6. **NetworkManager** - Manages WebSocket communication
7. **UIManager** - Controls user interface elements

### Server Architecture
The server-side implementation includes:

1. **Express/Node.js Server** - Hosts the WebSocket connections
2. **Socket.IO** - Manages real-time communication
3. **GameManager** - Handles game state, scoring, and player management

## Running the Game
The game is currently functional with both server and client components:

- **Server**: Running on port 3001 with Node.js and Socket.IO
- **Client**: Running on port 8080 with three.js and Webpack

## Next Steps

1. Complete unit and integration testing
2. Enhance visual aspects with more detailed models and textures
3. Add sound effects and background music
4. Implement additional game features
5. Optimize performance for smoother gameplay

## Conclusion
The Sword Duel game implementation has made significant progress with all core functionality now in place. The game features a 3D coliseum-themed arena, WASD movement, arrow key combat, auto-follow camera, and multiplayer support with WebSockets. Players can duel with basic attacking and blocking mechanics, with a three-hit win condition as specified in the original design documents.

Further enhancements will focus on improving visuals, adding sound, implementing more comprehensive tests, and optimizing performance.
